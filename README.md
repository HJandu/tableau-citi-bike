## <ins>Background</ins>
As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, I am now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In my new role, I am expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so my first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## <ins>About</ins>
My task was to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena. I was asked to design 2–5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total). I chose to work with 2018, 2019 and 2020 datasets, which I merged to help answer my chosen questions. 

The following are some of the questions I looked at:

* How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?

* How have the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

* What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months?

* What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the winter months?

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, I mention why I hypothesize these are the top locations.

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? 

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? 

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? 

* How does the average trip duration change by the type of user? 

* What is the average distance in miles for a bike trip?

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?

* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

I used the visualizations to design a dashboard for each phenomenon. The dashboards are accompanied by an analysis explaining why the phenomenon may be occurring. Within the dashboards, different maps were created. 

Finally, I created a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
